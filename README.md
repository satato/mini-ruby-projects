# Ruby Mini-Projects

### What is this?
This repository serves as a collection of mini-projects, done and detailed in Ruby, the instructions of which come from old university computer science exams which are intended to be used as study materials.

The implementation of each mini-project is my own, built to the specifications that I have provided as a .md file for each.

### *Why* is this?
While studying for my own computer science exams, I found a great deal of pleasure in the short implementation exercises detailed by each of these 'mini-projects', as I am calling them, and decided to collect them all in one place, as it feels a little silly for me to complete the challenges and then just keep them on my computer.

This repository makes it easy to identify my continuing growth and development as a programmer, even if just on a small scale, while also serving as a fun little addition to my otherwise-lacking portfolio. Rather than taking on big projects that I lack the time, experience, and mental bandwidth for, it feels more productive to continue to provide myself with occasional smaller exercises that work on more specific skills until I can gain more experience and freedom to work on bigger things.
